              When I was 21 years old, my boyfriend and I worked on a cabin renovation project in Idaho and were reimbursed 
              with tickets to Europe. Without much cash or preparation, only a Eurail pass and offers from strangers to let us
              sleep on their couches, we packed our backpacks and hopped a flight. Our first arrival was Reykjavic, Iceland. 
              A stunning country of bright green, mossy, volcanic hills and foggy skies. The water in our hotel room shower
              smelled like sulfur, because of the volcanic activity brewing just underneath the bedrock. We rented 
              a tiny car and went on a drive around the island, to check out the original Geyser and the volcanic landscape. On the
              way, we picked up a french hitchhiker, who was also an aspiring rapper. I think his name was Jean-Paul. 
              We liked him. We also visited the infamous Blue Lagoon, as seen here with infamous Bjork:

              After Iceland, we hopped another flight over to Oslo, Norway, where we ended up crashing on the couch of a stranger
              we met on Couchsurfing.com. We hung out in an ancient Viking cemetery on the night of Halloween (they don't celebrate
              Halloween in Norway, but to us it was very exciting). After Norway, we took a train to Stockholm, and stayed on the 
              couch of a friend who was an ex-pat. Stockholm was really fun - we partied a lot there. We also visited the Vasa museum,
              which houses a large shipwrecked boat and artifacts and skeletons recovered from the site.

            <p class="center">
              After Stockholm, we hopped another flight, this time landing in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is a lot of fun, everyone we met
              there was very friendly and we got to experience our first  Cannabis Cafe, which was very novel at the time. 
              From Amsterdam we boarded a Eurail train which would take us through 8 more countries over a period of about 3 weeks. 
              Our next stop was Hamburg, Germany, where we crashed on another ex-pat friend's couch for one night. We didn't stay 
              there long, and went straight on to Budapest, Hungary, where we crashed on another stranger's couch. Budapest had some 
              amazing secret bars, that would have been impossible to find, except that our host revealed them to us amonst the 
              identical Communist-era, Brutalist buildings. The secret bar we encountered had a cool, secret warehouse party vibe 
              and cheap mulled wine. We met a few other international travelers there, and had long conversations with them.

            <p class="center"> 
              From Budapest we hopped a sleeper-train to Romania, and it was one of the most relaxing train rides I can remember. 
              I recall being rocked to sleep by the train as we drove past vast hillsides under the stars. Upon arrival in Bucharest
              the next morning, we were welcomed with snow, which we hadn't anticipated. As a result, we spent much of our time there
              holed up in our tiny hotel room, wearing all the clothes we had at once in an effort to stay warm. The only time we 
              ventured out was to visit one of the alleged "Dracula's Castles". We took a packed, bumpy, and very unsafe bus ride to 
              one of the castles, only to have it close moments before arriving, which was a disapointment for me. 
              We quickly left Romania and ventured south to Greece, where we first arrived in Thessaloniki. There, a drunk old man at
              a cafe told me a story in broken English about when he once secretly boarded a freight boat to the US, then after his 
              story he handed me a rose.
              Next we stopped in Athens, where we saw the ruins of course. And then headed to Ancient Corinth, where we stayed in a 
              little bed and breakfast. The kind woman who ran it prepared a plate of beans for me to eat when I told her I couldn't eat meat.

            <p class="center">
              Next on the list was Italy. I forget where we first got in, but everywhere we went was super busy. So many people
              everywhere. We were fortunate to escape the city one night to meet my boyfriend's parents at a vinyard in the country
              which was truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. His parents footed the bill of a fancy house rental 
              and we slept on the floor. We drank Lemoncello while driving down the freeway. I was excited to discover that in Italy, 
              they serve high quality cappuccinos in their very clean gas stations, nothing like the gas stations I am used to in
              the US.
              After making one more stop, this time in Rome, we missed our train out of Italy and got trapped in the train station 
              overnight. We couldn't find a place to stay last minute, and ended up sleeping on the floor of the station. 
              The Roman train station was one of the scariest places I've stayed. Very weird things happened while we were there, like
              when an old man sat down next to me and showed me that he was carrying a hedgehog inside of a plastic shopping bag. Like 
              I said... weird.

              On our way to France, the French train attendants were not only mean, but scary! When our train missed its connection,
              we and all the other passengers were forced into a small room together and locked in. We couldn't speak much French,
              so we didn't know what was going on or what to do. Finally, they let us out, and we continued our journey into 
              Paris. Of course we saw the Eiffel tower, and walked along the Seine. I enjoyed France, but was very intimidated by the
              people there. After France, our last stop was Madrid, Spain. We made a point to visit the Reina Sofia museum to see their
              Salvador Dali exhibit, which was very exciting. The rest of the time, we stayed holed up in our hotel room, eating 
              tons of vegan buffet food and drinking lots of wine. It was heavenly. * * *
